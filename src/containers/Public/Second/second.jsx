      I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. 
      I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. 
      I am the fire that burns against cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. 
      I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."

       'Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you and you’ll never be free of the mockery.
        If they want to give you a name take it make it your own. Then they can’t hurt you with it anymore.'"
